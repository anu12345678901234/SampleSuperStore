## What I Have Done

Using the **Sample Superstore Dataset**, I created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard in **Power BI** to explore key business metrics. Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:

### 1. **Sales and Profit Analysis**:
   - Visualized yearly and monthly sales trends.
   - Compared sales and profit to identify high and low-performing periods.
   - Highlighted month-over-month growth and cumulative sales for better trend analysis.

### 2. **Customer Segment Insights**:
   - Created a pie chart showing sales distribution across **Consumer**, **Corporate**, and **Home Office** segments.
   - Analyzed profitability by segment to identify the most valuable markets.

### 3. **Regional Performance**:
   - Developed bar charts to compare total sales and profit across regions (**West**, **East**, **South**, **Central**).
   - Identified regions with high sales potential and low profitability for targeted improvements.

### 4. **Product Sub-Category Analysis**:
   - Visualized performance across product sub-categories (e.g., Chairs, Phones, Binders).
   - Highlighted profitable and loss-making sub-categories for strategic decision-making.

### 5. **Discount and Shipping Trends**:
   - Tracked discount patterns to evaluate their impact on sales and profit.
   - Analyzed shipping efficiency using "Days to Ship" trends and identified areas for operational improvement.

### 6. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Enabled filtering by **Year**, **Region**, and **Segment** to drill down into specific insights.
   - Provided a clean and user-friendly interface for stakeholders to interact with the data.
